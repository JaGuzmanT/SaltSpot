# 🏗️ SaltSpot Dataset: Salt Damage Detection in Concrete Structures 🏛️  

## 📌 Overview  

The **SaltSpot dataset** is a collection of **3,799 images** 📸 of concrete surfaces, specifically designed for **deep learning applications in civil engineering**. This dataset enables **automated detection** of **salt damage** 🧂 on concrete structures using **computer vision techniques**.  

This dataset was used in the research:  
📄 *"SaltSpot: A Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Classifying Salt Contamination Damage on Civil Infrastructure"*.  
If you use this dataset in your research, please **cite our work** (see **Citation** section below).

## 📂 Dataset Structure  

The dataset is divided into two **main classes**:  

- ✅ **Class 0 - •	Healthy structure:** Concrete surfaces without visible contamination or deterioration.  
- ❌ **Class 1 - •	Structure with salt damage:** Concrete surfaces with visible salt-related deterioration, including **spalling, scaling, discoloration, and crystal deposits**.
